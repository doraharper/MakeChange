## Make Change Project

### Skill Distillery Week 1 Homework

Program to make change. 

I had a general idea of how to start the program and it seemed pretty straight forward to set up. I even left Friday night thinking I had completed the project. I made the mistake of only tesing a whole number and not actually running the amounts that the project required.

I got hung up because I did not cast a double properly. I tried changing other things before realizing that I had done a casting mistake. I also went back and used if statements with the change to print out to say "bill" if only one bill was being returned and made it plural if more than one bill was being returned. 

I have it printing out the proper change and proper bill amounts!
